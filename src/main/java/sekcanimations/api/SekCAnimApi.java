 * This is where most stuff will be called to register animations and other stuff. Along with a few other classes in this package.
 * If you just need to control when the player is being rendered or some simple parts just use the SimpleAPI and dont make a dependency.
 *
 * Probably will be more like forge in terms of specific classes to access. E.g. possibly AnimManager.addPose(poseString) or .addTimeline(timelineString)
